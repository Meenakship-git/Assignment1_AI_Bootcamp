Many businesses struggle with unpredictable vehicle maintenance, leading to high operating costs and inefficient operations because they don't know *when* a vehicle might fail.\n",

It monitors simulated key vehicle health indicators (like engine temperature, brake wear, or oil pressure). Using a simple AI model, it can predict potential component failures *before* they happen. This allows fleet managers to schedule maintenance proactively, preventing costly breakdowns, extending vehicle lifespan, and keeping the fleet running smoothly.\n",

            "*   **Data Simulation & AI:** Python with libraries like Pandas (for handling data) and scikit-learn (for a basic predictive model like a simple classifier or regression based on thresholds). You can use Google Colab to prototype your AI.\n",
            "*   **Frontend/UI:** A simple web interface using HTML/CSS/JavaScript, or a Python-based dashboard tool like Streamlit or Dash to visualize vehicle status and upcoming maintenance alerts.\n",

It's incredibly cool because you get to experiment with AI/ML and data analytics to solve a tangible business problem.
